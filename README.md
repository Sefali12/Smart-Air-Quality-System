## 🚀 About The Project

**FreshLens AI** is an intelligent IoT-based system that scans food items and predicts their remaining shelf life using Computer Vision.

The device captures an image through **ESP32-CAM**, analyzes freshness with a trained AI model, and displays the estimated number of days before spoilage.

🎯 **Mission:** Reduce food waste and enable smarter kitchens with affordable technology.
